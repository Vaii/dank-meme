Random reaction gif generator

This reaction gif generator was made as a uni assigment so some of the functions of the application have no day to day use.
Such as the logging in, displaying which user uploaded it and rating the image. This would only have any use if it was an online database which might be done in the future.

This reaction gif generator lets you do the following things.

It let's you upload reaction gifs to the applications DB.
You can give it a name/categorie.
Once uploaded you can go to the generating bit, select the category of which you want a gif and click generate.
Once a random gif has been generated you can either chose to generate a new one, or upload it to imgur.
Once uploaded to imgur the link to the image will be set to your clipboard.
